I'm a master's student in [Data Mining Laboratory](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](
http://en.snu.ac.kr), where I'm advised by Prof. [U Kang](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang). My research interests
include large-scale graph processing and scalable machine learning. I received B.Eng. in Computer Science and B.Sc. in
Earth System Sciences at Yonsei University. Here is full [Curriculum Vitae](http://bit.ly/chiwanpark-cv).
