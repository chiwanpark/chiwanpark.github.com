# About

## Me

My name is Chiwan Park. I'm a undergraduate student majoring in Earth System Sciences and Computer Science in [Yonsei University](http://www.yonsei.ac.kr). I'm a developer interested in machine learning, distributed computing, and data processing.

I prefer to use Python or Java for my projects. Sometimes I use C/C++, Objective-C, Javascript, and PHP if need be.

I'm supported by Open Frontier Program which is program for open-source contributors by [NIPA](http://nipa.kr). For participating this program, I'm currently located in [Nuritkum Square](http://nuri.nipa.kr/), Seoul, Korea. I'm contributing [Flamingo Project](http://wiki.opencloudengine.org/display/IN/Flamingo) (Korean) and trying to contribute other projects. You can see my open-source activities in [Github](https://github.com/chiwanpark) or
[Apache Review Board](https://reviews.apache.org/users/chiwanpark/). There are some articles written by me in [this website](/articles/) (Korean).
