# About

## Me

My name is Chiwan Park. I'm a master's student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at [Seoul National University](http://en.snu.ac.kr/). I'm advised by [U Kang](http://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang). My research interests include large-scale graph processing and scalable machine learning. You can see my curriculum vitae and short biography from [here](/curriculum-vitae.html).

I prefer to use Python, Java or Scala for my projects. Sometimes I use C/C++, Objective-C, Javascript, and PHP if need be.

I'm contributing to [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org) and trying to contribute other projects. I also have my projects whose source codes are open. You can see my open-source activities in [Github](https://github.com/chiwanpark) or [Open Hub Profile](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/chiwanpark).
