# About

## Me

My name is Chiwan Park. I'm a undergraduate student majoring in Earth System Sciences and Computer Science in [Yonsei University](http://www.yonsei.ac.kr). I'm a developer interested in machine learning, distributed data processing and stream data processing.

I prefer to use Python, Java or Scala for my projects. Sometimes I use C/C++, Objective-C, Javascript, and PHP if need be.

I'm contributing [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org) and trying to contribute other projects. I'm supported by [Open Frontier Program](http://www.oss.kr/oss_dev_intro) (Korean) which is program for open-source contributors by [NIPA](http://nipa.kr). For participating this program, I'm currently located in [Nuritkum Square](http://nuri.nipa.kr/) (Korean), Seoul, Korea. You can see my open-source activities in [Github](https://github.com/chiwanpark) or [Open Hub Profile](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/chiwanpark). 

There are some articles written by me in [this website](/articles/) (Korean). Because I'm familiar with text-based language for writing such as CommonMark (the next generation of Markdown), LaTeX, and reStructuredText, Most of my articles are written in that languages.
